## ECS640 Big Data Processing

This repository contains my solutions to all the labs for Big Data Processing module at Queen Mary, University of London

### Get started

```bash
# cd into the correct lab
$ cd lab-<number>

# create a labenv
$ python3 -m venv labenv

# activate the labenv
$ source ./labenv/bin/activate

# install all the dependencies from requirements
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# to leave the env
$ deactivate
```

Each lab contains a `README.md` with the appropriate `bash` commands.

All the solutions are written in `python3`
